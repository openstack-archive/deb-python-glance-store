"""
A class that describes the location of an image in Glance.

In Glance, an image can either be **stored** in Glance, or it can be
**registered** in Glance but actually be stored somewhere else.

We needed a class that could support the various ways that Glance
describes where exactly an image is stored.

An image in Glance has two location properties: the image URI
and the image storage URI.

The image URI is essentially the permalink identifier for the image.
It is displayed in the output of various Glance API calls and,
while read-only, is entirely user-facing. It shall **not** contain any
security credential information at all. The Glance image URI shall
be the host:port of that Glance API server along with /images/<IMAGE_ID>.

The Glance storage URI is an internal URI structure that Glance
uses to maintain critical information about how to access the images
that it stores in its storage backends. It **may contain** security
credentials and is **not** user-facing.
