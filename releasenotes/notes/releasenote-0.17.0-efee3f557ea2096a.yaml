    Some deprecated exceptions have been removed. See
    upgrade section for more details.
upgrade:
  - The following list of exceptions have been deprecated
    since 0.10.0 release -- ``Conflict``, ``ForbiddenPublicImage``
    ``ProtectedImageDelete``, ``BadDriverConfiguration``,
    ``InvalidRedirect``, ``WorkerCreationFailure``,
    ``SchemaLoadError``, ``InvalidObject``,
    ``UnsupportedHeaderFeature``, ``ImageDataNotFound``,
    ``InvalidParameterValue``, ``InvalidImageStatusTransition``.
    This release removes these exceptions so any remnant
    consumption of the same must be avoided/removed.
