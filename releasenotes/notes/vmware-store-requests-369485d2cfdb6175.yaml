security:
  - Previously the VMWare Datastore was using HTTPS Connections from httplib
    which do not verify the connection. By switching to using requests library
    the VMware storage backend now verifies HTTPS connection to vCenter server
    and thus addresses the vulnerabilities described in OSSN-0033.
